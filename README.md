How To Use

1. Download The Server

Once you download the server, share your port number with your friend. Once they have downloaded the client, and you also must download the client, that is the only way you can chat. Add the port number of your server in the client; once you download the server, the port number will show up as soon as you open the download. Once you download the server, you control everything, and you can chat just like a hacker does.

2.Download The client

The client is where the fun starts. That's where you enter the port. number of your server that you downloaded, and then from there, you can start chatting with anyone; just tell them your port number. Now you literally have a private chat. The messages are never saved. Close the server, and it will close the connection. You must remember that your server changes ports every time you open the download. Remember, you are a hacker. So you must always share your port number; that way, it is very secure.
